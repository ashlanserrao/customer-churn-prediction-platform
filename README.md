#  Customer Churn Prediction Platform

An end-to-end, industry-ready machine learning system that predicts customer churn and exposes the model through a production-grade API with a React frontend dashboard.

This project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle — from business understanding and data analysis to model deployment and frontend integration.
